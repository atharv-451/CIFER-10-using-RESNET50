# CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50

This project implements object recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the ResNet50 architecture. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or later)
- pip (package installer for Python)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/atharv-451/CIFER-10-using-RESNET50.git
    ```
    
## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training and testing the model. It includes classes like airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `CIFER_10-Object Recognition using ResNet50.ipynb` in your preferred environment.

2. Execute the notebook cells to train and evaluate the ResNet50 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Neural Network Architecture

The project includes the implementation of a ResNet50-based neural network. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.

## Results

The model achieved [mention accuracy] on the test set. Training and validation loss/accuracy graphs are available in the notebook.
